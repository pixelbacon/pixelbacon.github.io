    <h2>What I Know</h2>

    <p>
      It takes a logical approach to chaos to make beautiful things. To push beyond the known limits for anything it takes that chaos. But to actually move forward it takes a logical approach; even if it's a bit crazy. I'm lucky to make a living at what I do, and I know the industry is always going to be changing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know after creating multiple consumer facing companies before I was 26 meant I was a bit too young to obtain a proper business loan, but worth trying despite odds.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know and understand that inputs are changing. Touch is a standard and gestures, eye movement, and brain activity are close behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this isn't just a job and more than a passion and curiosity, it's a hell of a ride and worth the extra hours. All of that in spades.
