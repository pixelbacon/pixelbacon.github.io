    <h2>What I Know</h2>

    <p>
      It takes a logical approach to chaos to make beautiful things.
      To push beyond the known limits for anything, it takes that discomfort and curiosity.
      But to actually proceed forward it takes a logical approach; making guideliens to remove the former discomfort.
      I'm lucky to make a living at what I do naturally, and I know the industry is always going to be changing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding that inputs are changing when it comes to devices, thoughts, and social progress is really where the strife comes from.
      And those changes need people to help guide them, and ease the discomfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this isn't just a job and more than a passion and curiosity, it's a hell of a ride and worth the extra hours when required.
      It's a responsibility to new ideas and cultivating their existence.
