    <p>
      I've been doing multimedia for 13 years. Before that it was designing with
      the original 3D printer: Legos. From sketch to meticulous crafting.
      Eventually the Web came along; and Lego's weren't part of the W3C standard.
      So I had to upgrade my skill set.
     </p>

     <p>
       That skill set expanded to Design, Photography, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
       PHP, ActionScript, Coding Design Patterns, User Interfaces,
       User Experience Design. Marketing, Print Design, Web Standards,
       Motion graphics, Mobile Design, and all the in betweens that are needed
       to make sure things go smoothly to and from all those areas.
     </p>

     <p>
       That skill set has lead to working with multi-national companies and
       showing them new ways to interact internally, with their customers, and
       gain new customers through real experiences.
