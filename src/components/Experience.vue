      It starting with designing through the original 3D printer: Legos. From
      sketch to meticulous crafting, what was in my brain as a simple idea was
      built out to a complex and tangible object. Eventually the Web came along;
      and Legos were not part of the W3C standard. So I had to upgrade my skill set.
     </p>

     <p>
       That skill set expanded to Design, Photography, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
       PHP, ActionScript, Coding Design Patterns, User Interfaces,
       User Experience Design. Marketing, Print Design, Web Standards,
       Motion graphics, Mobile Design/UX, and all the in betweens that are needed
       to make sure things go smoothly to and from all those areas with varying
       department sizes.
     </p>

     <p>
       That skill set has lead to working with multi-national companies and
       showing them new ways to interact internally, with their customers, and
       gain new customers through real experiences.
