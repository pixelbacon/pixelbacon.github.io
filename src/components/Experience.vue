    p It starting with designing through the original 3D printer: Legos. From sketch to meticulous crafting, what was in my brain as a simple idea was built out to a complex and tangible object. Eventually the Web came along; and Legos were not part of the W3C standard. So I had to upgrade my skill set.
    p That skill set expanded to Design, Photography, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, ActionScript, Coding Design Patterns, User Interfaces, User Experience Design. Marketing, Print, Web Standards, Motion graphics, Mobile, and all the in betweens. It took learning a lot of tools, working with a multitude of personality types to make sure things went smoothly.
